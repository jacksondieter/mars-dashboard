# Mars Rover Dashboard 

The Mars rover dashboard is a simple fullstack web application that consumes the NASA API. This dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. 

### Getting Started

To get started, clone this repo and run 

```yarn install``` 

Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

Create a file called `.env` and enter in your key for every request you make to NASA.

Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working.
